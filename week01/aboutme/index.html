    <p>Hello everyone, I'm Vance and I have a family of 3. I am currently live in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>

    <p>I am a product safety engineer and I am majoring in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I hope I can combine what I learn from coding and HTML/CSS to finish a shopping calculator.</p>
    <p>I like traveling and biking. I also like to watch youtube cooking channels.</P>
    <p>I learn some cooking tips from youtube and like to share the food with my family or friend while going camping.</p>
